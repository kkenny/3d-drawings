This Mario Bros planter is the third and last member of the geek planter collection. This planter has single and dual extrusion versions. Also, you can find it with or without holes (perfect for your office desk).

In this video, I explain the design process and some tips when assembling it: https://youtu.be/TRpGZDM_oW4

The filament used for this design is Innofil3D PLA (Gold and White PLA). It can be purchased here: https://www.innofil3d.com
